\section{Potential Damage Assessment}

In this section is described, in great detail, the scenarios introduced in section \ref{sec:Successful_Attack}. For this purpose we used as template the example in the book "Principles of incident response and disaster recovery" \cite {whitman5}. The two different scenarios are detailed in four steps each. A detailed description of the attack and the countermeasures taken is provided. This description is repeated for the Best case, worst case and most probable scenarios.

		\paragraph{Description:} The best case scenario it's when the fire doesn't produce damage to the building or any kind of asset. This can happen because the fire doesn't get to the building if produced outside or the fire extinguishing system works properly and it doesn't extend.
		\paragraph{Scenario risk:} Low, with the training of the employees for those situations. Also a good fire extinguishing system can prevent the extension.
		\paragraph{Scenario cost to organization:} moderate, the training of the employees can be done quite cheap. In the other hand the fire extinguishing system maintenance price it's quite expensive.
		\paragraph{Scenario probability of attack continuing and spreading:}none, once it's extinguished the threat is over.

	\multicolumn{2}{| p{12cm} |}{
		\paragraph{Description:} In this case the fire spreads all over the building making impossible to work there. It can also mean the loss of human assets, which is much worse.
		\paragraph{Scenario risk:}High, the hole enterprise must change the location. During that period the enterprise is vulnerable to any other kind of attack or threat. 
		\paragraph{Scenario cost to organization:} Very high, the reparation of the building and the necessity to use a different facilities during all the reparation time is a big cost for the enterprise.
		\paragraph{Scenario probability of attack continuing and spreading:}None, even though the big cost the fire cannot continue once it's extinguished.

		\paragraph{Description:} Minor fire that doesn't affect the hole structure of the building. It can cause minor disturbances in the business processes. It will not disturb the full enterprise procedure.
		\paragraph{Scenario risk:} Medium, the department affected by the fire will not be able to operate for certain time and should be relocated. The risk for human beings will continue to be low.
		\paragraph{Scenario cost to organization:}High, the rehabilitation of the building will be a high price. Also the training of the  employees includes an extra cost for the enterprise.
		\paragraph{Scenario probability of attack continuing and spreading:}None, even though the cost the fire cannot continue once it's extinguished.
