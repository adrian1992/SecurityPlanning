\section{Risk Identification}\label{RiskIdent}
A business like Smoking Games faces a wide variety of threats. Therefore it is necessary to consider every possible threat, what impact it might have on the business and how to control it. In the following we will focus on the realistic threads, while the unimportant threats are set aside, since the project's scope will otherwise overwhelm the organization's ability to plan.
