\item{\textbf{Idea Creation: }}This is the longest stage. It is a constant work in progress, during any stage the new ideas are taken into account. Once a project is finished a new idea is taken from the database.
\item{\textbf{Idea Study: }}At this stage the idea is studied to check if it is doable, profitable and innovative. If it doesn't give the expected results the game idea is discarded.
\item{\textbf{Game Creation: }}In this state the creative department starts the development of the project on itself. The development starts by programing the basic physics, story and the base program in general. When the 30\% of the estimated program is coded the design team starts working. At this early stage all the design is prepared for advertisement. While the game develops and the first alphas are launched the designers work more in the general graphics of the game.
\item{\textbf{Game Analysis: }}When the game is at about 60\% through the development process it's examined by the marketing department. If it gives clues for good and profitable sales it's approved and a marketing campaign is launched. If the game doesn't look good enough it's discarded.
