\chapter{Business Impact Analysis}
The business impact analysis (BIA) is divided into five parts\cite{whitman1}. The first part \ref{sec:IdentThreatsAttacks} deals with the analysis of the risk each threat poses to Smoking Games. Following from this, the Business Unit Analysis (BUA) is being performed \ref{sec:BusinessUnitAnalysis}, which indicates how the business would suffer under the loss of a business function. In part three \ref{sec:Successful_Attack} different scenarios of successful attacks are being discussed. From these attack scenarios, in part four \ref{sec:PotentDamAsses}, the costs of the best, worst and moste likely outcomes is being estimated. Finally, in part five \ref{sec:SubordPlanClass} the attack scenarios are being classified according to severity to determine which subordinate plan should deal with it.
