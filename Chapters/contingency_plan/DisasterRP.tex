\section{Disaster Response Plan}
The disaster response plan describes the actions to be taken by the disaster response team during an escalated incident scenario or disaster scenario. Tables \ref{tab:DRFire} and \ref{tab:DRDDoS} are Disaster plans already design, they can be used as an example for future disaster recovery plans as well. The template is extracted from ”Principles of Information Security and Disaster Recovery” \ref{whitman6} and describes the response plan step by step. First it describes the same as incident planning of the organizational aspect before the instruction set is shown. Then it describes the steps to take during the disaster, before stating when a disaster is officially ended. Then it might be over or it might escalate and the business continuity plan needs to be invoked. The plans also covers recovery on the primary site regardless of the business continuity plan.
