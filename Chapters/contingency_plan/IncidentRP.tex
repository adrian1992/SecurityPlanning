\section{Incident Response Plan}

All attack scenarios dictated by the ”subordinate plan classification addendum to end case”, to create an incident response plan, are added to this chapter. The specific plans can be found on tables \ref{tab:IRFire} and \ref{tab:IRDDoS}. The template used for all incident response plans is taken from the ”Principles of Incident Response and Disaster Recovery”. This details each action to be taken during an incident, when the incident is declared over, what actions to be taken when the incident is over, when the restoration process is over and which actions are to be taken in advance to an incident.\\
In addition to the incident response plan a shortened incident response plan is added, which describes the notification response corresponding to the incident. This can be found on tables \ref{tab:IDFire} and \ref{tab:IDDDoS}. This describes how the person, who discovered the attack and which actions they should take, when notifying the correct personnel.
