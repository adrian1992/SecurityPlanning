\chapter{Business Continuity Plan}
The BCP describes how Smoking Games moves from a fixed state to a temporary state, before transitioning back again. So in this case we have developed two possible situations where business continuity is needed. One is when the IT systems are down and the company has to set up a new temporary IT system. Another scenario is when the whole company has to relocate for some period of time. In the case of fire, it might be necessary to implement both plans.
