\chapter{Assets}
Smoking Games' assets can be categorized into tangible and intangible assets. Every service consulted or used by Smoking Games which benefits them or is more or less essential for business processes is considered an asset.
\section{Tangible Assets}
Besides the obvious assets like building, computers or other hardware, power, water and data and telecommunication services are essential for Smoking Games' business processes and procedures and are therefore considered an asset because when one of these services is not available anymore it will inflict damage on their business economy.
